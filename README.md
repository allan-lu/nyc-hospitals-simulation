# New York City Hospital Simulation Modeling 

New York City is currently at the epicenter of US COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this project is to model how well NYC hospitals can handle this crisis using a discrete event simulation method.

The authors of this paper developed a simulation model investigate the effects capacity and demand have on hospital performance. The focus was on the length of stay for long term care patients in various healthcare providers. Using a discrete event simulation, they projected demands and capacities through demographic data, and identified long term care service gaps in Kentucky. They used their results to invesitgate the impact of service improvements to long term care regarding patient wait time and resource allocation. The authors discovered a significant difference in length of stay between patients by gender and age. The DES was developed using _Simio_, a commercial software.
